# OpenEdge ABL language definition

## Things that do NOT work
- Grammar scopes are not supported right now, but will be; see [Priorities](#priorities)

## Priorities
- My first priority is fixing issues
- My second priority is adding missing keywords, support for abbreviations and other
- When those two points are done, I plan to completely rewrite the grammar to support scopes and other features of `TextMate` grammar

## What you should know about me
- I do not use OOP aspects of ABL, so there may be some gaps
- This is my first `TextMate` language grammar
- This is my first opensource project

That being said, I am super enthusiasthic helping the OpenEdge community. Any suggestions, help, feedback, advice, and critic is appreciated.
